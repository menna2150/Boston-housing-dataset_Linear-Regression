Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project predicts Boston housing prices using machine learning in a Jupyter notebook.

📌 What’s inside

Load and explore the Boston Housing dataset

Visualize data and check correlations

Train different models (Linear Regression, Ridge/Lasso, Random Forest, etc.)

Evaluate performance with metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²)

⚙️ Requirements

Install the basics:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


(Optional if you want):

pip install xgboost

▶️ How to run

Open boston_.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook

Run the cells step by step

Compare model results

✅ Notes

Linear Regression gives a good baseline

Regularization helps avoid overfitting

Tree-based models can capture non-linear patterns

Use results for learning purposes only (the dataset has fairness limitations)
